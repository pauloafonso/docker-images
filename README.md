# docker-images

Personal docker images. 

## Structure

Since github does not have groups structure, the branchs represent the resources (eg.: php-fpm, nginx) and contain the config files (Dockerfile, php-fpm config files, php.ini files, nginx config files, etc), and each branch is tagged with its Docker Hub image version.

For example:

* branch: php_fpm
* Tags: 8.3-v0.0.1, 8.3-latest
